Phase summary info:
   Count: number of times phase was executed
   Time and Flop: Max - maximum over all processors
                  Ratio - ratio of maximum to minimum over all processors
   Mess: number of messages sent
   AvgLen: average message length (bytes)
   Reduct: number of global reductions
   Global: entire computation
   Stage: stages of a computation. Set stages with PetscLogStagePush() and PetscLogStagePop().
      %T - percent time in this phase         %F - percent flop in this phase
      %M - percent messages in this phase     %L - percent message lengths in this phase
      %R - percent reductions in this phase
   Total Mflop/s: 10e-6 * (sum of flop over all processors)/(max time over all processors)
