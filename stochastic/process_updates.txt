1. Matrix is indefinite when the standard deviation of input gaussian increases.


Tested by checking eigen values.
- for small sigmaG = almost deterministic - matches a deterministic poisson problem.
-
- working now - Cijk was wrong.. mindex was corrected. Converging in just 8 iterations with 0.3 sd.


- Have to compare with random variable case.

- Compared with rv case - process code modified to have RV input pcs. Weak formulation same as process case. Perfect match between bot cases. tested with 100x 100 mesh and 3 order output expansion.

- Linear poisson has worked.

- moving to nonlinear poisson case now.
